## How to avoid wikipediasation?
Anyone with an internet connection is allowed and welcome'd to edit Wikipedia, but Wikipedia's moderation policy is clearly defined and top-down. How can an open, distributed knowledge platform become resilient to vandalisation without falling to censorship and/or top-down moderation?

## How to open up product and system design decision making?
Sofisti is and will be open-source, from tech to policy. However, while it is quite easy to publish source code and be transparent when it comes to decision-making, it is not easy to build an open process for product and system design decision making. How can we make sure that interested parties can join decision making?
