# Concepts

Sofisti aims to empower you to build your expertise on a field, without attending universities. Here is a glossary of concepts that are key on Sofisti.

## Fields

A field is a top level collection of knowledge. In terms of scope, it broadly maps to a University degree, such as _Mathematics_ or _Biology_.

## Domains

A domain is a subdivision of a field. This is a demarked section of knowledge or a thematic area that groups together several topics. Its scope broadly maps to a University course, such as _Linear Algebra_ or _Roman Law_. Resources are usually listed into domains.

## Topics

A topic is an atomic piece of knowledge. It usually can be understood on its own. Examples of topics are specific mathematical theorems or the complex concepts that define a domain. Resources can be mapped to topics, but usually books, courses and MOOCs will cover more than one topic.

## Resources

Resources are the material that we can use to study topics and domains. They can be internal (such as Questions and Answers, articles, etc) or external (references or links to books, videos, MOOCs. Topics and domains will list voted resources to aid you in your study, providing guidance on the material that can help you build your expertise and cement your confidence on a subject.

### (Internal) Questions and Answers

Questions can be attached to topics and domains. Any user can propose a question and any user will be able to post an answer. Questions and answers are voted by all users.

In general, the aim of a question is to create a challenge to ourselves or other users. Users can propose answers that are voted by other users, removing the need of a top-down validation of work, while ensuring that wrong answers are identified and shown as example, as we can learn from correct and incorrect answers.

### (External) Resource links

Users will be able to propose and vote links to good material, such as book official websites (not specific ecommerce links), videos and MOOCs. Links


### (External) Resource references

Resource references are just written descriptions of a resource, such as a review of a book.
