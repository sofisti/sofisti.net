# Why Sofisti?

Knowledge is power. For millenia, human beings have tried to collect data around the world and crafted stories attempting to understand it.

At the moment there are really only two ways to become a subject matter expert - Go to uni for years (time & money investment) or try your luck with a bootcamp of some sort (less time, more money, and more risky). There are a few choices for bootcamps when it comes to Software Engineering, but in reality bootcamps can't provide commercial expertise in the short amount of time they last.

In general all approaches at the moment are based on top-down evaluations. At uni or at bootcamps you have professors or other experts that evaluate you and then you are considered an expert. This is quite bad in terms of creating a culture of diversity. What I'd like to build is a bottom-up approach to learning & creating expertise, that is based on real-world results and not just "The prof created a task and I delivered what they thought was the right answer".

First step is to create a platform to collate information together. This is from a personal place - If I want to learn Mathematics and I don't want to go to uni, where do I find the topics I need to study and what are the resources that I can use to learn? And once I consumed those resources, how can I challenge myself to check I got the expertise?

Step two is to start study groups - People learning together and voting on resources & questions/answers. I am envisioning that you go to this app and you see a question, you answer and other people vote whether your answer is good or bad, possibly feeding back why it is not.

Step three is to actual create self-organising groups that can try out their expertise in real world projects. For example, FreeCodeCamp (the bootcamp I did to learn software engineering) connected people to charity and they could code (have real project) to help people. Builds a great, real CV and does good to people.
